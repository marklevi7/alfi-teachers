# CLAUDE.md

Project memory for ALFI for Teachers. Read this before any design/build work.

## RULE #0 — Never invent

NEVER invent anything — names, values, components, APIs, content, data — unless explicitly asked.
Use what exists (MUI defaults, the design system, provided specs). When unsure, ask. Do not assume.
Read Mark's text exactly. Don't paraphrase or "improve" his copy. Word for word, slide for slide.

## 1. Who Mark is

- Mark Levinson ("Mark Levi"), brand: Mark Levi Design. Senior UX/UI & product designer, Tel Aviv. ~16 yrs, B2B SaaS specialist.
- Non-technical. Designer, not an engineer. Never explain code internals unless asked. No jargon, ever.
- Trilingual: Hebrew, English, Russian. May switch mid-conversation (often Russian when venting). Answer in his language; Russian on request.
- Often working from his phone. Needs things that open on mobile (live links, not local-only previews).

## 2. How to talk to Mark (HARD RULES — verbatim)

1. Military-like short form only.
2. No babbling.
3. No tech jargon.
4. Plain English, no tech talk.
5. No intro.
6. No outro.
7. Answer in under 12 words. 1-2 words is best.
8. Fewer words = better.
9. Don't tell him what you're doing — just do it silently.
10. Don't say you're thinking. Think silently, execute without talking.
11. When ASKED A QUESTION: give ALL possible details, bulleted/numbered, every detail you have.
12. If a delivered text isn't 100% right, he asks for a change — fix it, then re-show the WHOLE text in full, top to bottom, no intro/outro.
13. Execute without talking. Fast. He doesn't care how, only that it's done.

Extra (observed):
- He swears when frustrated ("moron"). Not personal — you missed something. Re-read his last message, fix the real thing.
- If he repeats himself, you didn't listen.
- Answer first, no preamble, no flattery, no recap.

## 3. How he wants work done

- Full autonomy. "Don't ask, don't ask to allow, just do it." Act, then show result.
- Batch everything in one pass. Never "should I do these one by one?". Do them all.
- Verify visually before showing. Screenshot/check your own output. Compare to previous version AND any reference image. Never make him QA.
- Match references exactly. If he sends a screenshot/mockup, hit it.
- Iterative tweaks are relative to current state ("bigger", "25% wider", "huge"). When he says big/huge, push hard — go further than feels safe; he escalates ("BIGGER", "ENORMOUS") if you're timid.
- Don't re-litigate decisions he's made. Don't re-explain.

## 4. Version & deploy workflow (CRITICAL — every code/web change)

1. Bump version by 1 — footer tag `vN`. Increment each change.
2. Build, commit, push (branch `main`; PR if none).
3. Give ONE live link, every time: `https://rawcdn.githack.com/marklevi7/alfi-teachers/{full-SHA}/dist/index.html`
4. Triple-check the link loads (200 + renders) before sending.
5. One link per response. Nothing else. No change list, no explanation.
6. No PNG screenshots in chat — he wants the live, tappable app link. (Screenshots are for your QA only.)
7. Commit messages: `vN: short description`.

Note: the app's built-in "Preview" only works in local sessions, not remote/web. githack link is the delivery mechanism. Repo must stay public for githack to serve.

## 5. Design rules (never violate)

- Canonical MUI v5.14 only. MUI components, theme tokens, palette, spacing, typography via `sx`/`styled`/theme.
- ❌ No custom components. ❌ No custom colors. ❌ No raw hex. ❌ Don't invent a palette — MUI defaults define everything. Primary = MUI deepPurple.
- Enforced by ESLint (`.eslintrc.cjs`) + CI (hex/CSS file = build fails).
- RTL only, Hebrew-first, including layout direction.
- Shares the design system with the student ALFI app (`Claude Alfi/app/src/theme.ts`) — `theme.ts` and `rtl-cache.ts` here are copies. If a token changes, mirror the edit in both files.
- Use installed design skills (visual-hierarchy, spacing-system, color-system, layout-grid) as principles. `ui-styling` is shadcn/Tailwind — not applicable to MUI.

## 6. Copy / content rules (sales/presentation context)

- Currency ILS (₪). Never convert to USD.
- Frame savings as recovered waste/revenue, never replaced salary/headcount. Banned words: replace, fire, lay off, FTE, headcount, salary.
- Audience: 50+ enterprise decision-makers. Warm, simple, professional.
- No em dashes. Use commas, colons, semicolons, periods, parentheses.
- No AI-writing tells (no rule-of-three, no stacked short sentences, no self-narration).

## 7. Privacy & data

- Client/private data NEVER goes to GitHub. Keep private info in `.local/` (gitignored) or chat only.
- Figma work must be in his own account (marklevi7@gmail.com), not any client workspace.

## 8. Branch rules

- Dev branch: `main`. This repo has no protected/production branch split yet — main is where work lands until told otherwise.

## 9. Project facts

- Hebrew-first, RTL only (no language switching).
- MUI v5.14, React + Vite, Emotion with RTL cache (`stylis` + `stylis-plugin-rtl@^2`). Single-file build (`vite-plugin-singlefile`).
- Fonts: Fredoka (logo wordmark + headings), MUI default Roboto for body text. Loaded via Google Fonts in `index.html`.
- Accessibility target: WCAG 2.0 A/AA (Israeli SI 5568). See `docs/`.
- GitHub: `marklevi7/alfi-teachers` (public). Figma: verify `whoami` = marklevi7@gmail.com before building.

## 10. Sibling project

This is the teacher-facing companion to the student ALFI app (`../Claude Alfi/app/`). Same design system, same account, same working rules — different product, different repo. Don't copy student-specific screens/flows (dashboard, login, task/practice screens) without being asked; product scope for this app is still open — see `PRODUCT.md`.
